This template was created in order to avoid the redundant phase of the early design of a bot discord.

This template separates events and commands from the main bot discord file.

In this way, you can easily manage the modules of your bot.

Do not forget to modify the token of your bot to make it work under the good identifier.

In order to download the template, please first download Node.js and Ice Command Line Interface.

```
npm i -g ice-command-line-interface
```

Once done, download the template from a command prompt
```
ice make:project <project_name>
```
